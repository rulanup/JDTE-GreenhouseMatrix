The Greenhouse Matrix is a variable closed cuboid, **5–18 blocks** along each axis. All six outer faces must consist entirely of Matrix Casings, exactly one controller, and at least one of every port type.

Matrix Casings connect to neighboring casings, controllers, and ports in all six directions. Internal glass seams disappear while metal frames remain around the outer edges of each continuous glass surface.

The interior accepts Greenhouses, Large Greenhouses (including their parts), Matrix Enhancers, and air. The controller validates every five seconds and whenever its management screen opens. The screen reports the structure and managed machines, pauses every internal Greenhouse together, and globally disables internal crop rendering.

## Ports

- Item Input inserts only reusable plant templates.
- Item Output extracts from the controller's central long-count product buffer.
- Recipe Fluid Input distributes recipe-required fluids (Time Fluid by default).
- Energy Input distributes FE.

The controller exposes no automation capability; pipes must use the matching port.

Auto I/O is enabled by default in the management screen. Each port actively interacts with inventories or storage directly against its exterior face: Item Input pulls plant templates, Item Output pushes products, and the fluid and energy inputs pull their respective resources. Pipes can still connect directly and work alongside Auto I/O.

## Central Simulation

Once formed, internal Greenhouses no longer run recipe resolution, resource checks, and production independently every tick. The controller rebuilds their template, multiplier, and upgrade profiles in bounded batches, merges identical planting lanes into production groups, and advances those groups from real elapsed game ticks. Thousands of identically configured Greenhouses therefore settle only a small number of groups during stable operation.

FE and recipe-required fluids remain physically stored in the internal Greenhouses and form one pool across loaded members. New products enter a persistent controller-owned long-count buffer instead of the old internal output slots; items already present in those old slots are not deleted. The Item Output port, active Auto I/O, and a linked AE Output Upgrade all drain the central buffer, with AE using long-count batch uploads.

Real loot tables and dynamic crops use a bounded number of representative samples per group and scale the result to the group size. Seed and Essence conversions run before buffering. Paused matrices, unloaded members, and time while the game is closed do not receive catch-up production. Temporary structure invalidation does not clear buffered products.

## KubeJS: Configured Fluids

The Matrix runs the same `jdte:greenhouse` recipes as its managed Greenhouses and Large Greenhouses. This recipe makes potatoes consume water:

```js
ServerEvents.recipes(event => {
  event.remove({ id: 'jdte:greenhouse/potato' })
  event.custom({
    type: 'jdte:greenhouse',
    seed: { item: 'minecraft:potato' },
    outputs: [{ id: 'minecraft:potato', count: 2 }],
    display_block: 'minecraft:potatoes',
    growth_work: 20,
    fluid: 'minecraft:water',
    time_fluid: 100
  }).id('jdte:greenhouse/potato')
})
```

`fluid` defaults to `justdirethings:time_fluid_source` when omitted, while `time_fluid` is the amount consumed per harvest. Each managed machine has a single tank and does not mix fluids; Matrix production drains only matching recipe fluid. After `/reload`, old fluid remains extractable but powers only recipes that still match it.

## Block Enhancers

- Speed: +25% work per block, capped at +300%.
- Efficiency: -10% FE and recipe-fluid cost per block, capped at -80%.
- Seed: grants the Seed-to-Essence effect to every managed Greenhouse.
- Essence: grants Essence Conversion; essences with multiple crafting recipes remain unchanged.

## Auto-Crafting Enhancer

An Auto-Crafting Enhancer stores **16 encoded AE crafting patterns**. Each enhancer becomes one page in the controller screen. With several enhancers in the structure, pages use a stable block-position order and can be selected with the previous and next buttons. Patterns remain inside the enhancer itself and are all dropped when that block is removed.

Only AE **crafting patterns** are accepted; processing patterns are not. A pattern must also satisfy every rule below so the server can prove that the represented craft is legitimate:

- The 3×3 crafting grid may contain only one identical input item and component set.
- The recipe must not leave buckets, bottles, or any other remaining items.
- The pattern's claimed primary output must exactly match the item, components, and count produced when the server assembles the recipe again.
- A slot whose input, output, or recipe cannot be resolved is marked invalid in the screen and does not participate in production.

During settlement, the Matrix removes the recipe's real input count from its central long-count buffer and inserts the real output count. Outputs created by that settlement are not recursively crafted again in the same settlement. A modified pattern therefore cannot turn one Essence into 999 products.

**The Seed Enhancer conflicts with the Auto-Crafting Enhancer.** If both are present, structure validation reports `conflicting_crafting_enhancements` and the Matrix remains invalid until one type is removed.

## Global Upgrade Installation

Like a normal machine, the controller has eight upgrade slots and no extra dedicated slot. The controller-only **Greenhouse Matrix Quick Install Upgrade** can occupy any of those eight slots. Once installed, it unlocks eight additional global slots that accept stacked upgrade cards. Cards placed there are transferred one at a time into the real eight-slot upgrade inventories of managed Greenhouses and Large Greenhouses; they are not virtual effects.

The controller distributes cards round-robin and respects each Greenhouse's normal limits and conflicts. Cards that currently cannot be installed remain queued. The Quick Install Upgrade cannot be removed until the queue is empty.
